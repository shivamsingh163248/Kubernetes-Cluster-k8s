# Folder Structure Update Summary

## 🔄 Changes Made

### Folder Rename
- **Old**: `K8s/linux/modern/`
- **New**: `K8s/linux/comprehensive/`

### Rationale
The folder name "comprehensive" better reflects the complete and thorough nature of the learning materials provided, rather than just emphasizing that they are "modern."

### 1. Main README Files
- ✅ `K8s/README.md` - Updated directory structure and navigation links
- ✅ `K8s/linux/README.md` - Updated directory references and descriptions
- ✅ `K8s/linux/comprehensive/README.md` - Renamed from "Modern" to "Comprehensive" approach

## 🎯 Impact

### What Changed
- **Folder name**: `modern` → `comprehensive`
- **Branding**: All references to "Modern" approach changed to "Comprehensive" approach
- **Navigation**: All internal links and paths updated
- **Documentation**: Consistent terminology throughout

### What Remained the Same
- **File structure**: All subdirectories and files remain intact
- **Content quality**: All educational content unchanged
- **Learning path**: Same sequential approach
- **Technical content**: All commands, examples, and exercises unchanged
- **References to modern practices**: Kept where appropriate (e.g., "modern security practices")

## ✅ Verification

All files have been successfully updated with the new naming convention. The folder structure is now:

```
K8s/
├── README.md
├── linux/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── comprehensive/          # ← Renamed from "modern"
│       ├── README.md
│       └── basic/
│           ├── docs/
│           └── practical/
│               └── lab/
│                   ├── lab1/
│                   └── lab2/
```

The learning experience remains exactly the same, but now uses more appropriate terminology that better reflects the comprehensive nature of the materials.
