## 🎯 Learning Path Overview

### Phase 1: Theoretical Foundation (30-45 minutes)
**Location**: `K8s/linux/comprehensive/basic/docs/`

1. **Architecture** → Understand cluster components and how they work together
2. **Core Concepts** → Learn Pods, Services, Deployments, Namespaces
3. **Objects & API** → Master YAML manifests and kubectl operations
4. **Networking** → Understand service discovery and communication

### Phase 2: Hands-on Practice (2-3 hours)
**Location**: `K8s/linux/comprehensive/basic/practical/lab/`

1. **Lab 1** → Environment setup, basic operations, troubleshooting
2. **Lab 2** → Advanced deployments, scaling, monitoring

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Start with Theory
```bash
cd K8s/linux/comprehensive/basic/docs/
# Read documents in order: 01 → 02 → 03 → 04
```

### 2. Set Up Environment
```bash
cd K8s/linux/comprehensive/basic/practical/lab/lab1/setup/
chmod +x *.sh
./install-prerequisites.sh
./verify-installation.sh  
./create-cluster.sh
```

### 3. Complete Labs
```bash
# Complete Lab 1 first
cd ../  # Go to lab1 directory
# Follow README.md instructions

# Then move to Lab 2
cd ../lab2/
# Follow README.md instructions
```

## 📚 What Each Section Contains

### Documentation (`docs/`)
- **Comprehensive theory** covering all fundamental concepts
- **Architecture diagrams** and component explanations
- **Best practices** and real-world examples
- **Progressive complexity** building from basics to advanced

### Lab 1 (`practical/lab/lab1/`)
- **Automated setup scripts** for quick environment preparation
- **Step-by-step exercises** for basic operations
- **Complete solutions** and example configurations
- **Troubleshooting guides** for common issues

### Lab 2 (`practical/lab/lab2/`)
- **Production-ready scenarios** with Deployments and Services
- **Scaling and update strategies** with hands-on practice
- **Resource management** and health check implementation
- **Advanced troubleshooting** and monitoring techniques

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- [ ] Explain Kubernetes architecture to someone else
- [ ] Create clusters and deploy applications from scratch
- [ ] Write effective YAML manifests
- [ ] Debug common deployment issues
- [ ] Scale applications based on requirements

### Practical Validation
Demonstrate these skills by:
- [ ] Setting up a complete development environment
- [ ] Deploying a multi-tier application
- [ ] Implementing health checks and monitoring
- [ ] Performing rolling updates and rollbacks
- [ ] Troubleshooting production-like scenarios

## 🚀 Beyond the Basics

### Next Learning Steps
1. **Storage** → Persistent Volumes, StatefulSets
2. **Configuration** → ConfigMaps, Secrets, Environment Variables
3. **Security** → RBAC, Network Policies, Pod Security Standards
4. **Monitoring** → Prometheus, Grafana, Observability
5. **Cloud Integration** → EKS, GKE, AKS deployment

### Production Readiness
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Helm package management
- Service mesh implementation (Istio, Linkerd)
- GitOps with ArgoCD or Flux

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Learning Strategy
- **Sequential Completion** → Complete docs before labs, Lab 1 before Lab 2
- **Hands-on Focus** → 20% reading, 80% practicing
- **Experiment Freely** → Break things and learn to fix them
- **Document Learning** → Keep notes and create personal references

### Troubleshooting Mindset
- Always start with `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe`
- Check logs with `kubectl logs`
- Understand the event timeline with `kubectl get events`
- Use systematic debugging approaches
