## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will understand:

- ✅ Kubernetes core concepts and architecture
- ✅ Cluster, Control Plane, Nodes, and Pods
- ✅ Services, Deployments, and Namespaces
- ✅ Labels, Selectors, and Container management
- ✅ Local cluster setup using Kind/Minikube
- ✅ YAML manifest creation and deployment
- ✅ kubectl CLI commands and operations
- ✅ Troubleshooting and debugging techniques

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Linux environment (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- Basic command line knowledge
- Understanding of containers (Docker basics)

### Learning Path
1. **Start with Theory** → Navigate to `docs/` folder
2. **Practice Hands-on** → Follow labs in `practical/lab/`
3. **Sequential Learning** → Complete Lab1 before Lab2

## 📖 Course Structure

### Phase 1: Fundamentals (docs/)
- Kubernetes Architecture
- Core Components
- Basic Concepts

### Phase 2: Hands-on Practice (practical/lab/)
- **Lab 1**: Environment setup, cluster creation, basic operations
- **Lab 2**: Advanced deployments, services, and scaling

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Kind** → Local Kubernetes clusters
- **kubectl** → Kubernetes CLI
- **Docker** → Container runtime
- **YAML** → Configuration files
